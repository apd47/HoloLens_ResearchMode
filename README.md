# HoloLens_ReseachMode

This project is to exploit the Microsoft HoloLensâ€™s raw sensor data.

The research mode allows us to access key HoloLens sensors including: 
* The four environment tracking cameras 
* Two versions of the depth mapping camera data  
I. Short-range depth camera can sense depth from about 0.15m to 0.95m;  
II. Long-range depth camera can sense depth from about 0.95m to 3.52m. 
* Two versions of an IR-reflectivity stream 

## Enabling Research Mode:

## Settings that We Need to Change in a C# Project: 
Since the use of sensor data is a Microsoft restricted capability, we need to change some of the setting in Package.appxmanifest when building c# project.  

```
<Package
  xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10"
